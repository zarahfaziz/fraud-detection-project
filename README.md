# Fraud Detection at Retail Self-Checkouts


## Project Overview

Data Source: [Fraud Detection at self-checkout in retail](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oscarm524/fraud-detection-in-grocery-shopping-transactions?resource=download)

Purpose: Build a classification framework to estimate likelihood of fraud.

Methods / Tools Used: Machine Learning, Classification, PyCaret, Pandas



## Importance

Recently, newer methods of shopping are being tested with consumers; including self-checkout methods where the customer can scan / checkout items with handheld scanners. With these types of technological improvements to customer shopping experience, comes a risk of fraud. Without cameras or checkout clerks, it becomes difficult to know if customers are committing fraud by not scanning all items they are taking out of the store.

Research shows that approximately 5 percent of all self-checkout transactions have discrepancies. The research does not differentiate between actual fraudulent intent of the customer, inadvertent errors or technical problems with scanners.



## Objective

Create a model to classify the scans as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. 
The classification does not take into account whether the fraud was committed intentionally or inadvertently.

The goal of this project is to minimize losses by identifying cases of fraud using targeted follow-up checks, and by identifying as many false scans as possible.
The challenge of this method is to keep the number of checks as low as possible to avoid unnecessary added expense as well as to avoid putting off innocent customers due to false accusations.
